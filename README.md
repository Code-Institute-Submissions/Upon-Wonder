# Upon Wonder - The Band

Picture of site

This is a website to promote the **fictional** band Upon Wonder, including videos, photos, information about each band 
member, tour dates and a contact page to get in touch with the band. The goal for this page is to please both new and
excisting fans from all over the world to satisfy their individual need of reaching the information they want when
visiting the page.

My motivation for this web page comes from my own need to quickly and easily find the information I am looking for 
about a band I like. This may include brief information about each band member, a list of uppcoming tour dates and
where to find tickets, videos and images of the bands latest performances and a contact form through which I 
can send my compliments about the band and letters of admiration to tell the band how big of an impact they've made
for me.

This is the first Milestone Project in Code Institutes Fullstack Developer Education, and the requirements are to
make a responsive website using HTML and CSS3. This project was also made with Bootstrap which was an option to use
in the project use as well.

## UX/UI
The main purpose of the website is to break all information into smaller peaces in to its own pages to make it 
easier for the visitor to find it without getting lost in sections he/she does not want to go to in the first place.
The ideal visitor for this web page is not only fans that already know about the band, but also people who are
interested in finding out more about the band to eventually become a fan.

### UX/UI Goals
* Make navigation easy and clear for any visitor with good UX structure.
* Customize the web page to be fully responsive to fit all devices.
* Reflect the band's image through good color choices and fonts that accompany to all pages of the website.

### Visitor Goals
* Get information about the band itself.
* Get information about uppcoming tour dates.
* Get access to view high quality images and videos of the band.
* Be able to send a message to the band.

### Design Process
1. When I had decided about making a website for a band I started of by searching the internet for inspiration. I 
already had a brief idea of what the website structure was going to be, now I only had to come up with a theme and
pictures to work with.
I ended up on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) where I searched for potential images of people who looked like they
could be in a band, and found [this](https://unsplash.com/photos/MkgeKMXCPnw) picture. I was hooked and the theme
was set. I would make a website about a popular girlband touring the whole world.

2. After finding the picture of my band for the page I started to do my wireframes. One idea that I had was to make
the index page simple with a fixed background image, logo and a button which the visitor gets to press to enter the
"main paige" with all other information. This was to create a feeling in the visitor that they have now entered the world 
of the band.

- [About.html Wireframe](assets/wireframe/about-wireframe.png)
- [Gallery.html Wireframe](assets/wireframe/gallery-wireframe.png)
- [Tourdates.html Wireframe](assets/wireframe/tourdates-wireframe.png)
- [Mobile Device Wireframe](assets/wireframe/mobiledevice-wireframe.png)

3. I also had to come up with a logo for the band. I ended up finding the website [Hatchful](https://hatchful.shopify.com/onboarding/pick-space)
to create my logo and have used that all through my page.

4. To come up with the color scheme for the website I used the generating function of [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).
And the colors I ended up with and used for the entire page was the following:

- #0A014F (The dark blue color used in navbar and footer)
- #DB3069 (The bright pink color used on all buttons)
- rgb(220, 220, 227) (The light blue color used as background to the heading text on all pages)

5. Since the planning process as a developer is new to me, I realized quite quickly when I started building the 
website in code that the structure I made in Wireframes would not last in the end. The lack of continuity of the different
pages of the website was clear which led me to make changes to my original idea throughout the project.
The changes included the following:
- Adding a footer to the index page, to make the access to social links easier without having to go to the next page.
- Move the navbar links to the right to get a better balance to it.
- Adding hero images to all pages for a continuous feeling throughout the page.
- Change the image gallery layout to an image slider working as a hero image for the gallery page. For a cleaner look.
- Adding videos to the gallery for some variety in the media content.
- Making the tour dates page more similar in structure as the rest of the pages with the hero image and header text.
- Adding a map to the tour date page.
- Adding a contact page for fans to be able to send a message to the band.

## Features
The project has a total of five pages. The index page, about page, gallery page, tour dates page and contact page.
Four out of the five pages features a responsive navigation bar that contains the logo to the left and four options of wich
page the viewer wants to go to.

Each page has a footer with social media icons linking to the bands social media pages (As the band is fictional, 
the links only leads to the social media start pages.), and a text of copyright information.

### Index page
The index page contains of an image of the band that covers the whole viewport, the logo and a button. The purpose 
of this structure is to activate the viewer to click on the button and evoke a feeling that an experience awaits 
on the other side of the page. When you click the button you will go to the about page.

### About 
The about page features a hero image of the band again, and a logo on top of the hero image. The page includes 
a heading text with the title of the page, information about the band itself and also 
a presentation of each band member together with an image of them.

### Gallery 
The hero image section in the gallery acts as an image slider, with four different images from concerts. The page
includes a heading text with the title of the page, and under that a content of three videos with a descriptive 
text about each video content.

**Note!** This band is fictional and do not excist in real life. Therefore the videos used are only an example of
how videos will look like in this layout. The videos are free to use from Vimeo and the video makers are credited 
in the credit section of this readme file.

### Tour Dates 
The Tour Dates page starts of with an alert section on top of a hero image to inform the visitor about the 
cancellation of the 2020 tour. The message also includes a link that will redirect them to Ticketmasters webpage 
with information regarding the cancellation and rescheduling of live events.
Under the hero image the list of tour dates for the year of 2021 is presented. Each performance follows by a pink button
with the text "tickets" that leads the visitor to Ticketmaster where they can purchase tickets to the shows.
Under the tour dates list, there are two columns where the one to the left contains a text that encourages the visitor
to check out the map in the second column to find out where the next show will be.

### Contact
The contact page contains of a hero image followed by a heading text with the title of the page and some information
about how to get in touch with the band. Next follows a form with required input fields and a button to send the
message. In this case when you press the send message button an alert sign will appear that tells the visitor that
the bands inbox is currently closed.

### Features Left to Implement
Additional features to put in this project would ofcourse be to make it possible to send a message that actually goes
somewhere. Another additional feature to make would be a page with the bands merchandise that the visitor would be
able to purchase. A third feature left to implement would be to make it possible for visitors to be able to sign 
up for a newsletter subscription to get regular newsletters with information about upcoming albums, tours and other
exclusive updates and information from the band.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 - language for the project.
- CSS - for styling the HTML code.
- Bootstrap - mainly used for the responsive grid system byt styled accordingly to the theme of the website.
- FontAwesome - all icons on the website.
- Google Fonts - used for the "Roboto" and "Unica-One" fonts.
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) - all images used on the page (credits to the photographers further down).
- [Hatchful](https://hatchful.shopify.com/onboarding/pick-space) - used to create the logo for the band.
- [Embed Google Maps](https://www.embedgooglemap.net/en/?gclid=CjwKCAjwmMX4BRAAEiwA-zM4JoyJB_AMMTM8hXyyqUkgRPOhXRWv6NyhWXqxULExeMFMwcGrFYMOzRoCLf0QAvD_BwE) - used to embed google map address.

## Testing
### Different Browsers

### Validating the code

### The websites responsiveness

### Bugs found
* I noticed that the gallery-text-collumn in gallery.html became wider than the screen 
length after I decided to change the layout of the page. The margins on the left and right
where set to -15 despite the fact that I had no-gutters class and a css style that automatically would erase that
on all rows. This led me to google to try to solve this, but despite the tips I found there to try
to remove this problem it wouldn't work. I simply solved the bug by putting all text in its own
div and put in some extra css on the specific areas that where affected to eliminate the extra margins.

* When testing my website I noticed that the button on the index page wouldn't work on my Firefox browser when
looked at from my laptop. When I tried the website on my other, bigger screen the button worked perfect. It turned
out that the logo image (despite being transparent) was covering the button and wouldn't make it possible to press it.
This took me some time to figure out ofcourse and the internet wouldn't give me the answears I wanted. After discovering
the cause I was able to correct the issue by putting the button to a z-index of +2 and the logo to a z-index of +1.
