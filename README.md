The business aspect goals are the following:

## Features
Four out of the five pages features a responsive navigation bar that contains the logo to the left and four options of wich
page the viewer wants to go to.

Each page has a footer with social media icons linking to the bands social media pages, and a text that encourage the
viewer to do so. Additionaly there is also a text of copyright information. 

### Index page
The index page contains of a image of the band, the logo and a button. The purpose of this structure is to activate 
the viewer to click on the button and evoke a feeling that an experience awaits on the other side of the page.

### About 
The about page features a hero image of a concert from the audience's point of view, and a logo on top of the hero
image. The page includes information about the band itself and how they came together and also a presentation of
each band member with a member photograph each.

### Gallery 
In the gallery page, instead of a single image as hero image, an image slider provides the viewer to slide through four
different images as an alternative to a photo gallery.

Under the image slider three different videos

### Tour Dates 
The Tour Dates page starts of with an alert section to inform the visitor about the cancellation of the 2020 tour.
The visitor also gets the information that you can reschedule their excisting tickets or get a refund followed by
a link to ticketmasters webpage with information regarding the cancellation and rescheduling of live events.

Under the alert the list of tour dates for the year of 2021 is presented. Each performance follows by a pink button
with the text "tickets" that leads the visitor to a page where they can purchase tickets to the shows.

Under the tour dates list, there are two columns where the one to the left contains a text that says 
"Want to know where we're heading next? Check out the map!" and next to that column is a map to show where the next
show will be.

### Bugs and fixes
* I noticed that the gallery-text-collumn in gallery.html became wider than the screen 
length after I decided to change the layout of the page. The margins on the left and right
where set to -15 despite the fact that I had no-gutters class and a css style that automatically would erase that
on all rows. This led me to google to try to solve this, but despite the tips I found there to try
to remove this problem it wouldn't work. I simply solved the bug by putting all text in its own
div and put in some extra css on the specific areas that where affected to eliminate the extra margins.
