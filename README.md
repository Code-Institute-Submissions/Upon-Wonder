# Upon Wonder - The Band

Picture of site

This is a website to promote the **fictional** band Upon Wonder, including videos, photos, information about each band 
member, tour dates and a contact page to get in touch with the band. The goal for this page is to please both new and
excisting fans from all over the world to satisfy their individual need of reaching the information they want when
visiting the page.

My motivation for this web page comes from my own need to quickly and easily find the information I am looking for 
about a band I like. This may include brief information about each band member, a list of uppcoming tour dates and
where to find tickets, videos and images of the bands latest performances and a contact form through which I 
can send my compliments about the band and letters of admiration to tell the band how big of an impact they've made
for me.

This is the first Milestone Project in Code Institutes Fullstack Developer Education, and the requirements are to
make a responsive website using HTML and CSS3. This project was also made with Bootstrap which was an option to use
in the project use as well.

## UX
The main purpose of the website is to break all information into smaller peaces in to its own pages to make it 
easier for the visitor to find it without getting lost in sections he/she does not want to go to in the first place.
The ideal visitor for this web page is not only fans that already know about the band, but also people who are
interested in finding out more about the band to eventually become a fan.

### UX Goals
* Make navigation easy and clear for any visitor with good UX structure.
* Customize the web page to be fully responsive to fit all devices.
* Reflect the band's image through good color choices and fonts that accompany all pages of the website.

### Visitor Goals
* Provide visitors with information about the band itself.
* Provide visitors with information about uppcoming tour dates.
* Provide the visitor with high quality images and videos of the band.

### Design Process
1. When I had decided about making a website for a band I started of by searching the internet for inspiration. I 
already had a brief idea of what the website structure was going to be, now I only had to come up with a theme and
pictures to work with.

I ended up on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) where I searched for potential images of people who looked like they
could be in a band, and found [this](https://unsplash.com/photos/MkgeKMXCPnw) picture. I was hooked and the theme
was set. I would make a website about a popular girlband touring the whole world.

2. After finding the picture of my band for the page I started to do my wireframes. One idea that I had was to make
the index page simple with a fixed background image, logo and a button which the visitor gets to press to enter the
"main paige" with all other information. This was to create a feeling in the visitor that they have now entered the world 
of the band.

3. I also had to come up with a logo for the band. I ended up finding the website [Hatchful](https://hatchful.shopify.com/onboarding/pick-space)
to create my logo and have used that all through my page.

4. Since the planning process as a developer is new to me, I realized quite quickly when I started building the 
website in code that the structure I made in Wireframes would not last in the end. The lack of continuity of the different
pages of the website was clear which



Wireframes

## Features
Four out of the five pages features a responsive navigation bar that contains the logo to the left and four options of wich
page the viewer wants to go to.

Each page has a footer with social media icons linking to the bands social media pages, and a text that encourage the
viewer to do so. Additionaly there is also a text of copyright information. 

### Index page
The index page contains of a image of the band, the logo and a button. The purpose of this structure is to activate 
the viewer to click on the button and evoke a feeling that an experience awaits on the other side of the page.

### About 
The about page features a hero image of a concert from the audience's point of view, and a logo on top of the hero
image. The page includes information about the band itself and how they came together and also a presentation of
each band member with a member photograph each.

### Gallery 
In the gallery page, instead of a single image as hero image, an image slider provides the viewer to slide through four
different images as an alternative to a photo gallery.

Under the image slider three different videos

**Note!** This band is fictional and do not excist in real life. Therefore the videos used are only an example of
how videos will look like in this layout. The videos are free to use and the video makers are credited in the 
credit section of this readme file.

### Tour Dates 
The Tour Dates page starts of with an alert section to inform the visitor about the cancellation of the 2020 tour.
The visitor also gets the information that you can reschedule their excisting tickets or get a refund followed by
a link to ticketmasters webpage with information regarding the cancellation and rescheduling of live events.

Under the alert the list of tour dates for the year of 2021 is presented. Each performance follows by a pink button
with the text "tickets" that leads the visitor to a page where they can purchase tickets to the shows.

Under the tour dates list, there are two columns where the one to the left contains a text that says 
"Want to know where we're heading next? Check out the map!" and next to that column is a map to show where the next
show will be.

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used

## Testing
### Bugs and fixes
* I noticed that the gallery-text-collumn in gallery.html became wider than the screen 
length after I decided to change the layout of the page. The margins on the left and right
where set to -15 despite the fact that I had no-gutters class and a css style that automatically would erase that
on all rows. This led me to google to try to solve this, but despite the tips I found there to try
to remove this problem it wouldn't work. I simply solved the bug by putting all text in its own
div and put in some extra css on the specific areas that where affected to eliminate the extra margins.
