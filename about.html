                            and Jenna decided to attend the Royal College of Music in Stockholm to continue

                            inherited her interest
                            for music from her father John Wallin, who was a music teacher at the local
                            school. She managed to master both
                            guitar and drums and used to perform with her dad at local events in town.
                        </p>

                            craft but was always active in several music oriented
                            subjects on the nearby cultural schools.

                        <p class="roboto">Laura met Emma during her participation in Idol in 2015, but by
                            that time Laura wasn't interested in
                            joining a band. After a bit of persuasion from both Emma and Roger she decided
                            to finally try on the life as a member of a girl band.

                            along with the girls
                            in May 2019 when the band was looking for a new bass player. Maya was
                            born on January 2nd in 1992 in Stockholm
                            but grew up together with her grandparents on their farm in Nynäshamn.
                        </p>
                        <p class="roboto">Mayas grandfather teached her to play both the guitar and
                            bass, but singing has always been her
                            great passion as well. Maya also attended the swedish television show
                            Idol in 2018 where she ended up in 4th place
                            after a nerve wracking duel between her and Johanna Wikingsson after
                            they both ended up with the same voting score.
                        </p>
                        <p class="roboto">Even if she didn't win the duel over Johanna, Maya has won
